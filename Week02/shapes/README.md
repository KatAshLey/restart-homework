1) Create a parent class `Shape`
Only define the `def area()` interface function

2) Create a child/inherited class of `Shape`
For example `Triangle`
Define how Triangle is constructed (example below)
a, b, c
assert that it is a valid triangle
assert a+b > c (do this 3 times)
Define how `area()` is correctly calculated
Test out the definition of a Rectangle + correct area calculated

3) do the above for 3 more shapes
